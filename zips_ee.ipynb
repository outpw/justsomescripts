    "## Extracting Elevation Data for Zip Codes using Google Earth Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates zonal statistics operations using [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/). To replicate, you will need to [sign up for an Earth Engine account](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Zonal statistics calculate descriptive statistics across a zone of a [raster](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/what-is-raster-data.htm) data set, such as a satellite image or a digital elevation model (DEM). The zones, in this case, are boundaries of Zip Code Tabulation Areas. See Esri's description of [How Zonal Statistics Works](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/h-how-zonal-statistics-works.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using Earth Engine for this is the ability to run the operation on the cloud instead of having to download and process a large amount of digital elevation models. Instead, Earth Engine has the [National Elevation Dataset (NED)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_NED) as well as [Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/TIGER_2010_ZCTA5) vector data which you can manipulate on the cloud. The NED resolution is 1/3 arc-second, or about 10 meters at mid-latitudes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the Earth Engine Python API. This requires some [setup](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install-conda) and [credentials](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install-conda#get_credentials), but it's free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you would find higher standard deviation for elevations within zip codes that are smaller in area but have a large elevation range. People that live in those zip codes probably live closer to the minimum, rather than the mean or maximum. \n",
